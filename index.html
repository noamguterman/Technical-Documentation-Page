          The album is composed mostly of material that originally surfaced during the 
          band's early years as Majesty, and it is the only Dream Theater album to be 
          recorded with their full original lineup. James LaBrie replaced Charlie Dominici 
          as the lead vocalist on all subsequent albums.</p>

        <p>Images and Words is the second studio album by American progressive metal band Dream 
          Theater, released on July 7, 1992, through Atco Records.[1] It is the first Dream Theater 
          release to feature James LaBrie on vocals. Since its release, the album has maintained its 
          position as the band's most commercially successful studio album, and the song "Pull Me 
          Under" has the distinction of being the only Top 10 hit (radio or otherwise) the band has 
          had to date. This particular song has also had more recent success as it has appeared in 
          the 2008 video game Guitar Hero World Tour.[4]</p>

          Inspired by the audience response to Dream Theater's heavier songs while on tour,[5] in the

          "balls to the wall" album with heavier, darker riffing, exposing them to a number of new
